 * Shared shape passed to both the Pass-1 candidate-generation prompt and

 * GitLab terminology (MR instead of PR, project path instead of repo
 * full_name) and without coupling to the GitHub action's webhook payload
 * types.
 *
 * Kept platform-specific on purpose for v1; a follow-up will extract a
 * platform-neutral context into `src/core/review/`.
